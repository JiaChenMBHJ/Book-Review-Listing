## Instructions ##
Step 1. If needed, go to server directory (src/main/java/com/dotdash/chen/jia/demo) and set your own API_KEY in Config class.

Step 2. Build project and run BookListing.java in demo package.

Step 3. Open index.html in client directory and use one of the software to open the UI.

# Book Listing Exercise #

The purpose of this exercise is to test your familiarity with Java/Kotlin full-stack development.  You'll be building a small book listing app using frameworks of your choice and the Goodreads' public API.

## Functional Requirements ##
* The client app will accept the following command line arguments:
    --help Output a usage message and exit
    -s, --search _TERMS_ Search the Goodreads' API and display the results on screen.
        + Results must include author, title, and a link or display of the image of the book
    --sort _FIELD_ where field is one of "author" or "title"
        + Sorts the results by the specified field, if no sort is specified, title is the default
    -p _NUMBER_ if you choose to implement pagination, display the _NUMBER_ page of results
    -h, --host _HOSTNAME_ the hostname or ip address where the server can be found, should default to 127.0.0.1

* There should be a server component as well. The server component should provide REST endpoints that the client
  communicates with. The client should not directly contact the Goodreads API.
* The server should listen on a non-restricted port and the client should connect to that port.

## System Requirements ##

* The application must be written in Java or Kotlin
* You may use any Java/Kotlin frameworks / libraries that you see fit
* Errors that occur during processing should be logged and the user should be presented with a message asking them to retry.

## Non-Requirements ##

* Security measures, including user authentication / authorization
* Unit testing
* UX, as long as the application is usable.  As this is just an exercise the UX can be command-line only or use a console or
  GUI framework of your choice
* Logging, with the exception of errors

## Misc Notes ##

* https://www.goodreads.com/api/index#search.books (Key: RDfV4oPehM6jNhxfNQzzQ, Secret: fu8fQ5oGQEDlwiICw45dGSuxiu13STyIrxY0Rb6ibI).
* The Goodreads search API returns XML. Transform the XML into JSON and only send what your app will need
* Be sure to document your code, _especially cases where you might have made a different choice in a 'real' application_
* Upon completion, be sure that your code is accessible through a git repo, and provide the link to that repo to Dotdash

## Bonus Points ##

* Include pagination in the UI.
